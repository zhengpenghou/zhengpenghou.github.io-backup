# Hello!

It's been a long time since I wrote my last blog post. The last one I'd writen was about network.  Over the past 3 years, a lot things happened.  

Writing is not an easy task for me, I had tried with it from time to time before. Unfortuntely, it never ended well. Mostly, I gave up no more than couple of months, I even can't remember the longest period I had.  

After about 1 day's digging into Jekyll, I have my blog setup on GitHub. Thanks to the open source community which makes it possible to learn.an new technology this quickly.  The spirit is the fascinating aspect of why I like open source so bad.
